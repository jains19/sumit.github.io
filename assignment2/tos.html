        <h4>User responsibilities</h4>
        <p class="tos-content">
            Users are entrusted with maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials, promptly reporting
            any unauthorized use or security breaches. They are responsible for all activities under their accounts and
            must refrain from engaging in activities that violate laws or the outlined terms. The website reserves the
            right to take appropriate actions against violators, and users bear sole responsibility for the accuracy and
            legality of the content they contribute. Respectful conduct is expected, with harassment and disruptive
            behavior strictly prohibited. Compliance with all website policies is mandatory, and users are encouraged to
            report violations promptly. The website may terminate or suspend accounts for repeated violations, and users
            should stay informed about changes in the Terms of Service.
